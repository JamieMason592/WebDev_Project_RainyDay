Dear Ms. Martinez, 

Thank you for getting in touch about the website features you would like us to add. Per your request, we used CSS to add fonts and styling to the website. 

Thank you for bringing users with autism to our attention, we take accessibility seriously, so we have made sure that the website is accessible to autistic and neurodiverse users by implementing the following things: 

    A consistent layout for our webpages throughout to make sure users can easily tell where everything is. 

    Avoid animations and flashing elements that could overwhelm users. 

    Shorter paragraphs and text blocks properly divided by headings so that the website is clear for all users. 

We have deployed the website using GitHub at the following URL: https://jamiemason592.github.io/WebDev_Project_RainyDay/.  Let us know if you like the features and styling that we added, and please let us know if you have any further requests. 

Sincerely, 

Team RainyDay. (Jakub, Krystof, Jamie, Patrick)
