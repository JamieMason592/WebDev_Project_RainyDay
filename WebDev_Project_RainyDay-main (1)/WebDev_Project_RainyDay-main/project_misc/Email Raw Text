Dear Ms. Martinez,
	Our group at RainyDay has created the first prototype of the website for Anime Haven, to your specifications. We created a low fidelity prototype using Figma of the home page, 
  then from that foundation we created a home page, contact page, and an about page.

	On the home page, there is a section for “new releases” and “popular series”, and users can navigate to the other pages of the website. The about page describes what users can
  find on Anime Haven, as well as your mission regarding this community. The contact page will provide a means for users to get in touch with a possible future customer service team.

	Per your request, we have done our best to keep the website as easy to navigate and engaging as possible, please let us know if there are any changes or alterations you would like
  made to these prototypes.

	Sincerely,
Team RainyDay. (Jakub, Patrick, Krystof, Jamie)
